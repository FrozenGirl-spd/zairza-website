Website of Zairza Technical Society, the technical club at CET-Bhubaneswar.

## About us
ZAIRZA is a society and a cult for CETians who want to be ahead in the game.
Surely, we all have talent within us and here we put all our efforts, pass through
many obstacles, conquer over them and walk out as winners. The theory sections which
we read throughout these years are brushed and tested out resulting into newer ones.
The club is managed by its students and alumni. The society was founded in 2005 and 
it gained an official recognition as the technical society of CET in 2007.
